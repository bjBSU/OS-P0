## Known Bugs or Issues

there are no known bugs once I commented out the intentional bugs added in step 4.

## Experience

The project wasn't bad at all, in fact it was good practice in using codespaces and onyx. The largest hurdle I faced in this assignment was making sure that I was setting up the project in the right area of code space and making sure its connected to my repository. I at first tried to fork the code which didn't end up making sense but I had a friend help explain it to me and then I had no further problems.
